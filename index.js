     * The `node:child_process` module provides the ability to spawn subprocesses in
     * a manner that is similar, but not identical, to [`popen(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/popen.3.html). This capability
     * is primarily provided by the {@link spawn} function:
     *
     * ```js
     * const { spawn } = require('node:child_process');
     * const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh', '/usr']);
     *
     * ls.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
     *   console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
     * });
     *
     * ls.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
     *   console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
     * });
     *
     * ls.on('close', (code) => {
     *   console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * By default, pipes for `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` are established between
     * the parent Node.js process and the spawned subprocess. These pipes have
     * limited (and platform-specific) capacity. If the subprocess writes to
     * stdout in excess of that limit without the output being captured, the
     * subprocess blocks waiting for the pipe buffer to accept more data. This is
     * identical to the behavior of pipes in the shell. Use the `{ stdio: 'ignore' }`option if the output will not be consumed.
     *
     * The command lookup is performed using the `options.env.PATH` environment
     * variable if `env` is in the `options` object. Otherwise, `process.env.PATH` is
     * used. If `options.env` is set without `PATH`, lookup on Unix is performed
     * on a default search path search of `/usr/bin:/bin` (see your operating system's
     * manual for execvpe/execvp), on Windows the current processes environment
     * variable `PATH` is used.
     *
     * On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive. Node.js
     * lexicographically sorts the `env` keys and uses the first one that
     * case-insensitively matches. Only first (in lexicographic order) entry will be
     * passed to the subprocess. This might lead to issues on Windows when passing
     * objects to the `env` option that have multiple variants of the same key, such as`PATH` and `Path`.
     *
     * The {@link spawn} method spawns the child process asynchronously,
     * without blocking the Node.js event loop. The {@link spawnSync} function provides equivalent functionality in a synchronous manner that blocks
     * the event loop until the spawned process either exits or is terminated.
     *
     * For convenience, the `node:child_process` module provides a handful of
     * synchronous and asynchronous alternatives to {@link spawn} and {@link spawnSync}. Each of these alternatives are implemented on
     * top of {@link spawn} or {@link spawnSync}.
     *
     * * {@link exec}: spawns a shell and runs a command within that
     * shell, passing the `stdout` and `stderr` to a callback function when
     * complete.
     * * {@link execFile}: similar to {@link exec} except
     * that it spawns the command directly without first spawning a shell by
     * default.
     * * {@link fork}: spawns a new Node.js process and invokes a
     * specified module with an IPC communication channel established that allows
     * sending messages between parent and child.
     * * {@link execSync}: a synchronous version of {@link exec} that will block the Node.js event loop.
     * * {@link execFileSync}: a synchronous version of {@link execFile} that will block the Node.js event loop.
     *
     * For certain use cases, such as automating shell scripts, the `synchronous counterparts` may be more convenient. In many cases, however,
     * the synchronous methods can have significant impact on performance due to
     * stalling the event loop while spawned processes complete.
